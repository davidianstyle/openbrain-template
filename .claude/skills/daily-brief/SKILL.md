name: daily-brief
description: Produce today's daily briefing across all Google Calendars, Gmail accounts, Slack workspaces, and Asana. Writes to + Atlas/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md and surfaces anything that needs the user's attention today. Safe to re-run — refreshes the `## Morning brief` section in place.

# /daily-brief

Assemble the user's daily briefing for today (or a date passed as `$1`). Creates or updates the matching daily note in `+ Atlas/Daily/`. Re-runnable: the skill replaces the `## Morning brief` section in place rather than appending a new one.

## Inputs

- `$1` (optional): target date in `YYYY-MM-DD`. Defaults to today.

## Procedure

> **Date check first.** Before any other work, if `$1` is not supplied, resolve "today" by running `Bash: date "+%Y-%m-%d %A %H:%M %Z"`. Do **not** trust the session-injected `currentDate` field — it can lag the real clock by a day. Use the shell result as the target date for everything below.

> **Parallelization:** steps 1–6 are all independent read-only gathers. Fan out **every** MCP call — all `google_*` accounts, all `slack_*` workspaces, all configured Asana workspaces, and Fathom — in a single tool-use block. Do not serialize across accounts or across steps.

1. **Calendar sweep.** For each `google_*` MCP, call `google_calendar_list_events` for the target date (00:00 → 23:59 local). Merge into a single timeline; tag each event with the owning account slug. Collapse duplicate events that appear on multiple calendars (same title + time).
1b. **Fathom recordings.** Call `mcp__fathom__list_meetings` for meetings in the last 24h. For each, note title, participants, and whether a summary is available. Surface under a **Recent recordings** section in the brief — title, attendees, and a `fathom:<meeting-id>` reference the user can pass to `/capture-meeting` if they haven't already processed it.
2. **Priority mail.** For each `google_*` MCP, `google_gmail_search_emails` with `is:unread newer_than:2d (is:important OR is:starred OR label:^iim)`. Cap at 5 per account. Capture subject, sender, account slug.
3. **Slack attention.** For each `slack_*` MCP, search for mentions of the user in the last 24h and list unread DMs. Cap at 10 per workspace.
4. **Overdue tasks.** For each configured Asana workspace (`asana_personal`, `asana_work`), `asana_get_my_tasks` with `completed_since=now`, `opt_fields=name,due_on,due_at,completed,assignee_section.name,projects.name,permalink_url,recurrence`, and post-filter to due date < today. The `recurrence` field is mandatory — see "Asana display ordering" below for why.
5. **Stale relationships.** Grep `+ Atlas/People/*.md` for notes whose `last_contact` is older than their `cadence` allows (weekly: > 7d, monthly: > 30d, quarterly: > 90d, asneeded: never stale). Cap at 5.
6. **People detection pass.** From the calendar attendees + priority mail senders/recipients + Slack counterparties gathered in steps 1–3, check each identifier against `+ Atlas/People/*.md` frontmatter (`emails`, `slack`, `title`, `aliases`). Unknown humans (after filtering no-reply/bots/resources per `/people-sync` rules) become a **New faces** candidate list — do not stage stubs from this skill; just surface them. Recommend `/people-sync` if the list is non-empty.
6b. **Draft replies for actionable threads.** After steps 1–6, draft responses for "Needs a reply" items where the user is the next actor. Skip:
   - Items classified as `Delegated / FYI` (care team, ops auto-alerts)
   - Observer-only threads
   - Automated notifications (Asana digests, Dependabot, commercial mailing lists)

   For each actionable item:
   1. **Resolve account + thread.** Use the `google_*` MCP that surfaced the message (from step 2), or the `slack_*` workspace (from step 3).
   2. **Gather context.** Read the full thread via `google_gmail_read_email` on the matching `google_*` MCP (using the message ID from step 2). Check `+ Atlas/People/` for the sender's person note — pull open commitments, recent interactions, and relationship context. For Slack, read the thread via `slack_<slug>_conversations_replies`.
   3. **Compose draft.** Match the user's voice (see CLAUDE.md §6). Lead with the ask or the answer. For email: use `Re: <original subject>`. For Slack: no subject.
   4. **Save draft.**
      - **Email:** `google_gmail_draft_email` on the matching `google_*` MCP with `threadId` + `inReplyTo` set so it appears as an in-thread reply.
      - **Slack:** `mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_send_message_draft` with `channel_id` + `thread_ts` if replying in-thread. (This is the one approved use of the deprecated connector — see CLAUDE.md §9.)
   5. **Log vault trail.** If the sender resolved to a person note, append a bullet under its `## Threads` section: `- <date> · drafted follow-up (<channel>:<draft-id>) — <one-line gist>`. Do NOT update `last_contact` — a draft is not a touchpoint.

   **Parallelization:** fan out all `google_gmail_read_email` / thread-read calls in one tool-use block, then fan out all `google_gmail_draft_email` / `slack_send_message_draft` calls in the next block.

7. **Compose the daily note.** If `+ Atlas/Daily/<date>.md` does not exist, scaffold from `+ Extras/Templates/Daily.md`. If a `## Morning brief` section already exists in the note, **replace its body in place** (find the `## Morning brief` heading and overwrite everything up to the next H2 or EOF). Otherwise insert a new `## Morning brief` section near the top. Contents:
   - **Today's calendar** (merged timeline, grouped bullet list, `[HH:MM–HH:MM] Title · account-slug · other attendees if any`)
   - **Recent recordings** (Fathom meetings from last 24h not yet captured as interaction notes — title, attendees, `fathom:<id>` ref; omit section if empty)
   - **Needs a reply** (mail + slack, grouped by account/workspace)
   - **Drafted replies** — list of drafts saved in step 6b. One bullet per draft: `- ✉️ [[Person]] — Re: Subject · gmail draft <draft-id> · <account>` (or `💬` for Slack). Include a footer: `_(Review and send from Gmail / Slack. Drafts are not sent automatically.)_`. Omit the section if no drafts were generated (all items were delegated/FYI).
   - **Overdue in Asana**
   - **People past cadence** (link with `[[wikilinks]]`)
   - **New faces** — unknown humans seen in today's activity, one line each with source context. Omit the section if empty.
   - A single-line **Focus suggestion** based on the above
8. Never touch any other section of the daily note. Only the `## Morning brief` section is managed by this skill.
9. **Refresh `Dashboard.md` at the vault root (optional).** If a `Dashboard.md` file exists at the vault root, this skill is the primary owner of its forward-looking sections and rebuilds them on every run. **Skip this step entirely if `Dashboard.md` does not exist** — log a one-line warning and move on. Only run when the target date is **today**; historical reruns must not retroactively rewrite the dashboard. Procedure:
   - For each H2 section listed below, **replace the body in place** (find the heading and overwrite everything up to the next H2 or EOF). Never touch `## Quick links` (static) or sections owned by `/daily-review` and `/weekly-review`.
   - **Owned by `/daily-brief`** (rebuild every run):
     - `## Today — <Day YYYY-MM-DD>` — pivot meeting + 5–8 line condensed timeline of today's anchors. Update the heading date too.
     - `## Needs a reply / open loops` — same data as the brief's "Needs a reply" section, but formatted as one bullet per item with `[[wikilinks]]`. Filter out delegated/FYI noise.
     - `## People past cadence` — same content as the brief's section.
     - `## Delegated / FYI` — auto-alerts and FYI items surfaced today that the user does not need to action.
   - **Owned by `/weekly-review`** (only refresh if the section is missing or older than 7 days — otherwise leave alone): `## This week (...)`, `## Top priorities`. Compare the dashboard's frontmatter `updated:` field against today; if `updated >= start-of-week`, leave these sections alone. If they need refreshing and `/weekly-review` hasn't run yet, generate a "stub" version from current Asana + calendar data so the dashboard isn't stale.
   - **Frontmatter.** Update the `updated:` field to `<today>` after writing.
   - **Idempotence.** Re-running `/daily-brief` on the same day must produce the same dashboard (modulo any new mail/slack/calendar deltas). Never append; always replace section bodies in place.

## Output shape

Create or refresh the `## Morning brief` section in `+ Atlas/Daily/<date>.md`, plus the dashboard sections owned by this skill in `Dashboard.md` if it exists (see step 9). Report a short summary of what was (re)generated to the user in chat — including the dashboard refresh status.

## Asana scope note

Step 4 ("Overdue tasks") is for the brief itself. For the dashboard's `## Top priorities` stub generation in step 9, widen the Asana query to include tasks with `due_on` between today and today + 7 days, grouped by workspace. Use the same `asana_get_my_tasks` call — just don't post-filter to `< today`.

## Asana display ordering

Whenever this skill renders a flat list of Asana tasks (in the `Overdue in Asana` section of the brief, the `## Today` must-do block of the dashboard, or the `## Top priorities` lists), **group by repeat frequency** with subheadings and sort least-frequent → most-frequent so high-stakes items bubble to the top.

**Source of truth: the Asana `recurrence.type` field. Never guess from the task name.** Heuristics are unreliable — task titles rarely encode their repeat cadence.

**Required opt_fields.** When this skill issues `asana_get_my_tasks` (step 4) or any task fetch that will feed into a display list, **`recurrence` MUST be in `opt_fields`**. Standard fetches don't return it. The recommended opt_fields string for this skill: `name,due_on,due_at,completed,assignee_section.name,projects.name,permalink_url,recurrence`.

**`recurrence.type` → display group mapping:**

| `recurrence.type` | Display group | Order |
|---|---|---|
| `never` | **One-off** | 1 (highest priority) |
| `yearly` | **Annually** | 2 |
| `monthly` | **Monthly** | 3 |
| `weekly` | **Weekly** | 4 |
| `daily` | **Daily** | 5 (collapsed at bottom) |

If `recurrence` is missing from a task response (e.g. an API error or older field set), treat as `never` and flag the task with a `?` so the user can verify.

Within each group, secondary sort by `due_on` ascending. Omit empty groups. Render group labels as bold inline labels (`**One-off**`, `**Annually**`, etc.) — do NOT use H3 since these live inside an H2 section. This grouping is the **default** behavior when no explicit alternative sort is in effect.

## Notes

- **Idempotent by design.** Running `/daily-brief` twice on the same date replaces the section rather than duplicating it. The section header stays `## Morning brief` (the name reflects content intent, not the time of day the skill was invoked).
- Never **send** any email or Slack message — this skill creates drafts only (step 6b). Drafts are not sent; the user reviews and sends from the native client.
- If a given MCP server fails, note it in the brief (`_(google_<slug>: unavailable)_`) and continue.
- Respect the `#workspace/personal` vs `#workspace/work` split only if the user asks for a single-workspace brief (e.g. `/daily-brief work` → skip all `workspace=personal` sources). Without a flag, include everything.
